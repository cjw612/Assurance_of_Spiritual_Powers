- ### Project Summary
  - #### Project Overview
    This project is aimed to conceptualize the assurance of Spiritual Powers in a contemporary Taiwan context with Songshan Ciyou Temple as an example, one of the most culturally and historically significant temples in Taiwan. This project leverages multiple qualitative research methods, such as Participant Research and Grounded Theory. This project is led by Professor Ke-Hsien Huang from the Department of Sociology at National Taiwan University and is co-authored with five people, serving as the final report of the course Qualitative Research Methods.

  - ### Results Summary
    The embodiment of ritual practices in the in-temple volunteer communities and external believers has reproduced the Spiritual Powers of Ciyou Temple, reinforcing the religious bond between deities and volunteers through the practice of rituals. In addition, the religious heterogeneity and cosmopolitan nature of the temple have augmented the basis of its Spiritual Powers with modernized Bureaucratic methods and publicized religious experiences.
